# Mini-project: library management (Frontend).
## This frontend part is still developing and lack a lot of functions 
( This is the frontend part written in Spring boot. You can find the backend part here: <a>https://github.com/anhngo0/library_management.git</a> )

I build the common pages (those no need to login) based on japan foundation library website. There you can find many manga, magazines and Japanese books in a quiet and modernly decorated space. If you are a fan of japanese books and culture, this library is definitely a great choice to visit and enjoy.
